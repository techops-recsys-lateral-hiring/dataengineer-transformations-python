In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been 
        turning over in my mind ever since. Whenever you feel like criticising any one,
         he told me, just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages
         that you've had.
        Most of the big shore places were closed now and there were hardly any lights except the 
        shadowy, moving glow of a ferryboat across the Sound. And as the moon rose higher the 
        inessential houses began to melt away until gradually I became aware of the old island 
        here that flowered once for Dutch sailors' eyes--a fresh, green breast of the new world. 
        Its vanished trees, the trees that had made way for Gatsby's house, had once pandered in 
        whispers to the last and greatest of all human dreams; for a transitory enchanted moment 
        man must have held his breath in the presence of this continent, compelled into an 
        aesthetic contemplation he neither understood nor desired, face to face for the last time 
        in history with something commensurate to his capacity for wonder.,
        And as I sat there, brooding on the old unknown world, I thought of Gatsby's wonder when 
        he first picked out the green light at the end of Daisy's dock. He had come a long way to 
        this blue lawn and his dream must have seemed so close that he could hardly fail to grasp 
        it. He did not know that it was already behind him, somewhere back in that vast obscurity 
        beyond the city, where the dark fields of the republic rolled on under the night.,
        Gatsby believed in the green light, the orgastic future that year by year recedes before 
        us. It eluded us then, but that's no matter--tomorrow we will run faster, stretch out our 
        arms farther.... And one fine morning----,
        So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past
